# Deep-Neural-Network-Based-Cosmological-Parameters-Estimation

Developed deep neural network models to estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and
matter/dark energy density from Hubble and supernova data, using simulated datasets with noise modeling and
uncertainty estimation, and validating results against standard statistical inference techniques.
